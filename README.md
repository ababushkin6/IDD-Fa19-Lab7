# Video Doorbell, Lab 7

## Part A. HelloYou from the Raspberry Pi

**a. Link to a video of your HelloYou sketch running.**

## Part B. Web Camera

**a. Compare `helloYou/server.js` and `IDD-Fa18-Lab7/pictureServer.js`. What elements had to be added or changed to enable the web camera? (Hint: It might be good to know that there is a UNIX command called `diff` that compares files.)**

The differences that were added were the webcam section. This included initalizing the package, followed by setting the capture options for the webcam. Finally, the function for taking a picture, saving it, and then displaying it was added. 

**b. Include a video of your working video doorbell**

## Part C. Make it your own

**a. Find, install, and try out a node-based library and try to incorporate into your lab. Document your successes and failures (totally okay!) for your writeup. This will help others in class figure out cool new tools and capabilities.**

The package used helped me change the webcam into random pictures on click into a motion detecting continuous camera that has the options of recording video or taking snapshots. 

**b. Upload a video of your working modified project**
